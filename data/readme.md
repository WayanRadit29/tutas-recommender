# Tutas Recommender â€“ Synthetic Data Generator

This repository provides a pipeline for generating **synthetic datasets** to train and evaluate a recommender system.  
It creates student profiles, tutor profiles, and labeled interactions, which can be used to prototype and test machine learning models.  
All data is **synthetic** (using Faker + custom logic) and safe for demonstration or educational purposes.
